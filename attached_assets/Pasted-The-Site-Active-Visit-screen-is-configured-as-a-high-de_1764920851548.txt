The "Site Active Visit" screen is configured as a high-density Field Monitoring Dashboard. It is designed to give a Field Manager complete situational awareness of a specific active survey mission.

Here is the comprehensive breakdown of the screen's configuration:

1. Data & State Configuration
The screen is driven by three core data models (currently mocked):

COLLECTOR_DETAILS: Stores the enumerator's profile, device status (Battery 82%, Signal 4G), and real-time metrics (Quality Score 98%, Avg Duration 14m).
RECENT_SUBMISSIONS: A log of the last 3 household interviews, including their validation status (Valid vs. Flagged).
ALERTS: System warnings (e.g., "GPS Drift detected").
2. Visual Layers
Map Background:
Base Layer: Minimalist greyscale city map with a technical grid overlay.
Target Pin: A red pulsing pin marking the "Sector 4 Health Center".
Live Tracker: An animated blue avatar representing the enumerator moving across the map, complete with a "Green Dot" indicator for online status.
Heads-Up Display (HUD):
Top Right: Status pills showing Connectivity ("Online - WiFi") and Local Time ("10:45 AM").
Top Left: Global navigation menu.
3. The Dashboard Panel (Bottom Sheet)
The main interface is a scrollable bottom sheet divided into three tabs:

A. Header Section (Sticky)
Mission Banner: Displays the active mission ID (#SV-882) and Site Name.
Real-Time ETA: Large, readable "3 min" indicator showing arrival time.
B. Tab 1: Overview (Operational View)
Enumerator Card: Displays the photo, name, role, and Device Telemetry (Battery level, Signal strength, Sync status).
KPI Grid:
Target Progress: Visual bar showing 12/25 completed (48%).
Quality Score: 98% (Green), calculated based on interview protocols.
Alert Stream: Color-coded warnings (e.g., Amber for "GPS Drift").
C. Tab 2: Submissions (Data Quality View)
Record Log: A list of recent households (e.g., HH-104).
Validation Flags: Instant feedback on data quality (e.g., "Flagged: Duration < 5m").
D. Tab 3: Technical (Device Health View)
Diagnostics: Detailed readouts for troubleshooting:
GPS Accuracy: 4.2m
Satellites Locked: 8
App Version: v2.4.1
4. Action Bar
