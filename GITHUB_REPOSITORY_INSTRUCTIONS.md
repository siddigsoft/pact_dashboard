3. ✅ Set description: "PACT Workflow Platform - Comprehensive MMP Management System for field operations"
4. ✅ Repository is now **private** - only you can see it

## Next Steps - Push Your Code

To push your code to the new repository, you have two options:

### Option 1: Use the Provided Script (Recommended)

1. Open the Shell tool in Replit
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/push-to-pact-siddig.sh
   bash scripts/push-to-pact-siddig.sh
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Push

If you prefer to do it manually, run these commands in the Shell:

```bash
# Add the new remote
git remote add pact-siddig https://github.com/siddigsoft/PACT-Siddig.git

# Check your current branch
git branch

# Push to the new repository (use 'main' or 'master' depending on your branch)
git push pact-siddig main
# OR
git push pact-siddig master
```

## Verify Your Repository

After pushing, visit your repository at:
**https://github.com/siddigsoft/PACT-Siddig**

You should see all your PACT Workflow Platform code there!

## Repository Features

Your new repository includes:
- Full source code from the PACT Workflow Platform
- All configuration files (vite.config.ts, package.json, etc.)
- Supabase schema and configuration
- React components and pages
- All assets and styling

## Important Notes

- 🔒 The repository is **private** - only you can access it
- Your Supabase secrets (VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY) are stored securely in Replit Secrets and are **not** pushed to GitHub.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **"Remote already exists" error**: This is normal if you run the script multiple times
2. **Authentication required**: The push will use HTTPS and may ask for your GitHub credentials
3. **Branch name issues**: Make sure you're using the correct branch name (main or master)
